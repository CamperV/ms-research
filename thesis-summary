THESIS RESEARCH SUMMARY

------------
The Problem:
------------

- Proper tracking and segmentation require accurate shadow removal/recognition pertaining to foreground objects
- Shadow removal methods fail to perform optimally in diverse environments
- Shadow removal methods fail to adapt over time to universal factors such as:
  - illumination changes
  - light/shadow color changes
  - underlying texture quality and quantity
  - foreground object size 
  - etc.
- There are a myriad of shadow detection methods, but none fully compnesates for each other's weaknesses
- Shadow removal methods tend to require hand tuning for an environment in regards to parameters such as:
  - attentuation thresholds 
  - average foreground object size
  - gradient direction thresholds
  - H,S,V thresholds
  - cone thresholds
  - Canny edge thresholds
  - etc.
Problem: No leading shadow removal methods are robust enough to compensate for a scene over time, nor are they suitable for deployment in an environment without a priori tuning of parameters. 

  Object tracking and segmentation are pivotal to most preeminent computer vision applications, ranging in application from security and surveillance, to traffic monitoring and analysis. Notably, many applications utilize the extraction of foreground pixels to capture moving objects in a scene; however, since shadows share movement patterns with foreground objects (and have a similar magnitude of intensity change compared with the background model), they tend to be extracted alongside the desired object pixels [Sanin et al.]. While this may occasionally be the intention, shadows generally contribute to inaccurate object classifications and impede proper tracking of foreground objects. In order to rectify this, there have been a bevy of developments regarding shadow detection and removal from foreground objects. In order to perform optimally, these leading methods require assumptions to be made about key factors of a scene, including illumination changes, color variance, clearly defined foreground objects, etc. As a result, no leading shadow removal methods are robust enough to compensate for a scene over time, nor are they suitable for deployment in an environment without a priori tuning of parameters. The objective of this research is to develop a framework capable of understanding salient scene parameters that affect shadow removal, and implement said shadow removal for an arbitrary scene for an arbitrary length of time.

Proposed Research:
------------------

- RE: The Problem. Since algorithms alone are deficient, develop framework capable of understanding salient enviornmental/scene parameters that affect shadow removal, and implement shadow removal in a two stage system:
  - Macro: select which popular removal method is best suited for the scene based of holistic content analysis
  - Micro: automatically tune the parameters necessary for the selected algorithm to perform optimally in an arbitrary environment
- Sensitivity testing of large data sets for shadow removal performance with hard coded parameters
- Technical challenge: Identify salient scene/environmental parameters that affect shadow removal performance. This necessarily extends to these scene parameters that affect other algorithms. There is current research that attempts to quantify what makes a scene a scene, but the research has not been extended to correlate their affect on algorithmic methods
- Develop adaptive scheme for shadow removal without designing a new catch-all algorithm
- Create an understanding of a scene using statistical machine learning methods

    As stated above, no leading shadow removal methods are robust enough to compensate for a scene over time, nor are they suitable for deployment in an environment without a priori tuning of parameters. The research proposed will attempt to solve this problem by establishing an understanding of scene parameters that negatively affect shadow removal using leading methodology, and use that understanding to perform optimal shadow removal in an arbitrary environment. This requires the creation of a hybrid scheme consisting of two stages: a macro stage which selects the proper shadow removal method apropos of ambient scene properties, and a micro stage that automatically tunes the selected method to optimally perform given the collected scene properties.
    The prior assumptions that are required for leading shadow removal methods to perform optimally very rarely lend themselves to quantization or scalability; e.g., a geometric method exercised in this research clearly performs optimally in situations with clearly defined upright objects with predictable shapes. Methods like this one require more of an understanding of semantic scene content rather than stricter parameters such as color saturation. Therefore the technical challenge of the proposed research lies in properly quanitfying salient scene properties and content, especially in how these properties pertain to algortihmic methods such as shadow removal. The algorithmic parameters of the selected shadow removal methods can number more than 30 for a particular method. Accordingly, the proposed research requires relatively large-scale sensivity testing for these parameters in different scenes. The large number of algorithmic parameters incites the need for identifying not only how these parameters affect shadow removal according to the scene's environment, but also how these parameters affect each other.
    Lastly, in order to create a framework for shadow removal divorced of previous assumptions, the framework requires an understanding of how soon-to-be identified scene parameters change over time. There is a need for adaptivity in most applications requiring shadow removal, and in the process of obtaining the diverse data sets necessary for this research, the degree to which certain scene parameters change over time can be observed.

Work Completed:
---------------

- Demonstrated differing shadow removal methods perform better according to the scene it is applied to
- Demonstrated a need for hard-coded parameters of certain methods to perform best for scenes (or even work at all, in some cases)
- Observed already a small need for coarse grained decision making
- Created graphical framework for rapidly evaluating efficacy of methods 
- Created graphical framework for rapidly evaluating efficacy of parameters in multiple scenes, including the ability to modify them in real-time to observe effects
- Created framework to quickly permute parameters and values via an .ini file system that adjusts in real-time, allowing an external script to manipulate values interatively, creating large sets of data showcasing shadow removal efficacy dependant on the articulated parameters

  Much of the work completed up to this point has involved development of tools and processes for analyzing, comparing, and evauluating shadow removal methods in differing environments. Standardized implementations of popular shadow removal methods, including ground truths, backgrounds, and frames, are used courtesy of A. Sanin, C. Sanderson, B.C. Lovell (http://arma.sourceforge.net/shadows), licensed under GPL v3+ and written in C++. These shadow removal methods are as follows:
  - Chromacity: an approach contingent on color constancy and brightness variance.
  - Physical: an approach centered around attenuation based on the color of the source illumination (white for inside, yellow for outside, etc).
  - Geometry: an approach that evaluates the moments of mass of foreground objects, and attempts to find the shadow pixel based on projective geometry.
  - Small Region Texture: an approach that attempts to match shadow pixels based on the underlying background texture. This approach achieves this using Gabor filtering.
  - Large Region Texture: a similar approach to that of Small Region, Large Region matches shadow pixels based on direction gradient matching.
A more complete taxonomy of these approaches will be provided with the research. The datasets used by Sanin et al. were also provided, and as such will be utilized in this research for more direct and accurate evaluations.
  These implementations (by Sanin et al.) came with hardcoded parameters that were found to be correspondent with the provided datasets. Prominent parameters include:
  - H,S, and V thresholds for color evaluation.
  - Global Attentuation thresholds .
  - Average foreground object sizes.
  - Gradient direction thresholds.
  - Canny edge thresholds.
There are many more mutable parameters that affect shadow removal efficacy, and again, a more complete taxonomy will be provided. In order to then quickly evaluate the affect of modifying these in-built parameters, a graphical interface was created to adjust them during runtime and view the effects. The interface supports either entire sequences (e.g. video) or singular frames. The interface supports any of the aforementioned shadow removal methods. The efficacy of any method on any frame is then evaluated with the popular metrics Detection and Discrimination (seen below). These formulae measure how many shadow pixels are correctly identified, and how many foreground object pixels are correctly preserved, respectively. Snapshots of the graphical interface are also shown below.

[GUI screens]

  This interface is a cruicial development in terms precisely measuring each parameter's affect on a given scene. However, in order to study sahdow removal in terms of adaptivity over time, a more procedural method was required. Courtesy of brofield and licensed under MIT, SimpleINI (github.com/brofield/simpleini) allowed for creation of .ini files containing any given removal method's default parameters. The algorithms themselves were then modified to allow for runtime modifications to made to these parameters, meaning a procedural, iterative approach to analysis was created. A python script capable of writing to this .ini file allows for rapid permutation of parameters and values.

  [params.ini screens]

  With all of this created infrastructure, initial research has begun. The thrust of the initial research was to first and foremost prove the problem claimed above, that these leading algorithms are not suitable for arbitrary deployment, and they can be improved with parameters corresponding to their environment. As an example, a parameter dictating the lowest allowable value (HSV) for determined shadow regions is modified. 

  [Ground truth] [frame]

  For this demonstration, gray pixel represent detected shadows, with white pixels representing foreground object pixels. For a more quantitative angle, the Detection and Discrimination rates are included in the frame. The demonstrated parameter (vThreshLower) causes the LR Texture removal method to perform optimally in the CAVIAR scenes at its default value, 121. Similarly, the same algorithm performs poorly in the included dataset aton_highway1 with the default parameters. 

  [caviar default] [highway1 default]

  However, if vThreshLower is modified from 121 to 15, the following is observed:

  [caviar15] [highway1 15]

  As evident above, the parameter change causes the same algorithm to perform significantly better in the aton_highway1 frame, and poorly in the CAVIAR frame. This justifies the need for the 'micro' stage of the proposed research, in which the algorithms' parameters would be adequately tuned according to their environment. For a second demonstration, the Geometry shadow removal method was found to also showcasse different results on the same scene, but with differing parameters.

  [Geometry frame] [geometry ground truth]

  By changing such parameters as the saturation thresholds, changes in the shadow removal efficacy is evident by both increases and decreases in accuracy. Each shadow removal method has been found to have hard-coded, mutable parameters that affect the shadow removal in a given environment.
