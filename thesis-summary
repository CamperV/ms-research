THESIS RESEARCH SUMMARY

------------
The Problem:
------------

- Proper tracking and segmentation require accurate shadow removal/recognition pertaining to foreground objects
- Shadow removal methods fail to perform optimally in diverse environments
- Shadow removal methods fail to adapt over time to universal factors such as:
  - illumination changes
  - light/shadow color changes
  - underlying texture quality and quantity
  - foreground object size 
  - etc.
- There are a myriad of shadow detection methods, but none fully compnesates for each other's weaknesses
- Shadow removal methods tend to require hand tuning for an environment in regards to parameters such as:
  - attentuation thresholds 
  - average foreground object size
  - gradient direction thresholds
  - H,S,V thresholds
  - cone thresholds
  - Canny edge thresholds
  - etc.
Problem: No leading shadow removal methods are robust enough to compensate for a scene over time, nor are they suitable for deployment in an environment without a priori tuning of parameters. 

  Object tracking and segmentation are pivotal to most preeminent computer vision applications, ranging in application from security and surveillance, to traffic monitoring and analysis. Notably, many applications utilize the extraction of foreground pixels to capture moving objects in a scene; however, since shadows share movement patterns with foreground objects (and have a similar magnitude of intensity change compared with the background model), they tend to be extracted alongside the desired object pixels [Sanin et al.]. While this may occasionally be the intention, shadows generally contribute to inaccurate object classifications and impede proper tracking of foreground objects. In order to rectify this, there have been a bevy of developments regarding shadow detection and removal from foreground objects. In order to perform optimally, these leading methods require assumptions to be made about key factors of a scene, including illumination changes, color variance, clearly defined foreground objects, etc. As a result, no leading shadow removal methods are robust enough to compensate for a scene over time, nor are they suitable for deployment in an environment without a priori tuning of parameters. The objective of this research is to develop a framework capable of understanding salient scene parameters that affect shadow removal, and implement said shadow removal for an arbitrary scene for an arbitrary length of time.

Proposed Research:
------------------

- RE: The Problem. Since algorithms alone are deficient, develop framework capable of understanding salient enviornmental/scene parameters that affect shadow removal, and implement shadow removal in a two stage system:
  - Macro: select which popular removal method is best suited for the scene based of holistic content analysis
  - Micro: automatically tune the parameters necessary for the selected algorithm to perform optimally in an arbitrary environment
- Sensitivity testing of large data sets for shadow removal performance with hard coded parameters
- Technical challenge: Identify salient scene/environmental parameters that affect shadow removal performance. This necessarily extends to these scene parameters that affect other algorithms. There is current research that attempts to quantify what makes a scene a scene, but the research has not been extended to correlate their affect on algorithmic methods
- Develop adaptive scheme for shadow removal without designing a new catch-all algorithm
- Create an understanding of a scene using statistical machine learning methods

    As stated above, no leading shadow removal methods are robust enough to compensate for a scene over time, nor are they suitable for deployment in an environment without a priori tuning of parameters. The research proposed will attempt to solve this problem by establishing an understanding of scene parameters that negatively affect shadow removal using leading methodology, and use that understanding to perform optimal shadow removal in an arbitrary environment. This requires the creation of a hybrid scheme consisting of two stages: a macro stage which selects the proper shadow removal method apropos of ambient scene properties, and a micro stage that automatically tunes the selected method to optimally perform given the collected scene properties.
    The prior assumptions that are required for leading shadow removal methods to perform optimally very rarely lend themselves to quantization or scalability; e.g., a geometric method exercised in this research clearly performs optimally in situations with clearly defined upright objects with predictable shapes. Methods like this one require more of an understanding of semantic scene content rather than stricter parameters such as color saturation. Therefore the technical challenge of the proposed research lies in properly quanitfying salient scene properties and content, especially in how these properties pertain to algortihmic methods such as shadow removal. The algorithmic parameters of the selected shadow removal methods can number more than 30 for a particular method. Accordingly, the proposed research requires relatively large-scale sensivity testing for these parameters in different scenes. The large number of algorithmic parameters incites the need for identifying not only how these parameters affect shadow removal according to the scene's environment, but also how these parameters affect each other.
    Lastly, in order to create a framework for shadow removal divorced of previous assumptions, the framework requires an understanding of how soon-to-be identified scene parameters change over time. There is a need for adaptivity in most applications requiring shadow removal, and in the process of obtaining the diverse data sets necessary for this research, the degree to which certain scene parameters change over time can be observed.

- Demonstrated differing shadow removal methods perform better according to the scene it is applied to
- Demonstrated a need for hard-coded parameters of certain methods to perform best for scenes (or even work at all, in some cases)
- Observed already a small need for coarse grained decision making
- Created graphical framework for rapidly evaluating efficacy of methods 
- Created graphical framework for rapidly evaluating efficacy of parameters in multiple scenes, including the ability to modify them in real-time to observe effects
- Created framework to quickly permute parameters and values via an .ini file system that adjusts in real-time, allowing an external script to manipulate values interatively, creating large sets of data showcasing shadow removal efficacy dependant on the articulated parameters

- Develop holistic scene content understanding in order to select shadow removal method in macro stage of hypervisor program
- Create correlation between quantitative global scene/environment properties and shadow removal accuracy
- Develop understanding of how these scene/environment parameters change over time of day (rather than just between locales)
- Use the aforementioned correlation to build hypervisor program to deploy adaptive shadow removal in arbitrary scenes and environments
- Collect appropriate long-term data for adaptivity research
