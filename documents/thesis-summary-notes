Title:                                    Maybe for thesis proper
Problem statement:                        Too vague and ambitious
                                          Develop framework, demonstrate extensibility on scene variations
                                          Does it occur more outdoors?

1) Discovery:                             What scene chars matter?
2) Feature Extraction Techniques:         Which are effective/efficient?
3) Prediction:                            What algorithm is best? What params to modify/use?
4) Demonstrate feasibility:               Use a 'slice' of 2) + 3), extraction for limited features

Context:                                  IoT, arbitrary environments/outdoors
Semantic scene content:                   Abstraction level? 
History:                                  Printed paper: address if the problem is solved/how well.
Figures:                                  Highlight currently adjusting parameter
                                          Duplicates: Explain the dichotomies
ini Method:                               New name...
Long term datasets:                       indoor/outdoor contradictions
Bibliography:                             Make one
