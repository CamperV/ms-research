Results sections based on figures:

Correlations of coneR1 --- 
Correlation with LowC Saturation KPs --- 
Brightness Models and their x-y spreads --- 
Efficacy of brightness models dependent on dataset --- 
yellowshift of each dataset --- 
total det/discrimination improvements per coneR1-avgAtten correlation --- 
model of avgAtten improvement --- 

Three main sections:

coneR1 correlation results (add lowC Sat)

RGB Shift and Brightness Models correlations

Model Creation Recap and Model results (all brightness methods)
