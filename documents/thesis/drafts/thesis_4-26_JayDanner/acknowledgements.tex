I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my two advisors, Dr. Linda Wills and Dr. Lee W. Lerner, for their unwavering support and dedication to my success at Georgia Tech. Dr. Wills embodies the spirit of kindness, and I could not imagine a better mentor. I hope to carry a fraction of her patience, knowledge, and passion with me as I continue forward. Dr. Lerner has been a constant ally to my success over the years I have known him. I admire and respect both who he is and what he does, and I am honored to have had his support.

I would also like to thank Dr. Patricio Vela, Dr. Ayanna Howard, and Dr. James Hamblen for serving on my reading committee. I am grateful for your time, energy, and insight.

I cannot quantify the support my wife, Marcella, has provided. Her unflagging encouragement, warmth, and love through long nights and hard days cannot be matched. You are a blessing in my life, and I truly couldn't have done it without you.
